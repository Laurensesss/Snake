Here is a little game we all played when we were young.☺️

## Declaration
One of my classmates and I created it in a half month about one month ago. It’s kind of wasting time. But I think it’s also worthy. This is the first time I’m in a team and create things together. In the future, I think I’m going to keep using GitHub to work with others and keep moving, learning and making progress.💪💪💪
